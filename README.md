# AI DevOps Platform

A cloud-native, AI-powered monitoring platform designed to help DevOps teams proactively identify anomalies, predict issues, and optimize their infrastructure using machine learning.

## Overview

This platform consists of two main components:

*   **`central-brain`**: A cloud-hosted service (running on AWS ECS) that ingests metrics, performs anomaly detection, and sends alerts.
*   **`edge-agent`**: A lightweight, containerized agent that is deployed to your infrastructure to collect and forward Prometheus metrics.

The entire infrastructure is managed via Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines are set up using GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the components.

## Architecture

*   **Data Collection**: The `edge-agent` scrapes a local Prometheus instance for all available metrics.
*   **Data Ingestion**: The agent sends the collected metrics to the `central-brain`'s secure `/ingest` endpoint.
*   **Processing & Storage**: The `central-brain` processes the incoming data, runs anomaly detection algorithms (currently on the `up` metric), and stores the data in a DynamoDB table.
*   **Alerting**: If an anomaly is detected, the `central-brain` sends an alert via Telegram.
*   **Infrastructure**: All backend components (ECS, DynamoDB, S3, ALB, etc.) are provisioned on AWS using Terraform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   An AWS Account
*   Terraform installed
*   Docker installed
*   A Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID for alerts

### 1. Infrastructure Deployment

The core infrastructure is managed by Terraform.

1.  **Configure AWS Credentials**: Ensure your environment is configured with AWS credentials that have permissions to create the required resources.
2.  **Initialize Terraform**:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/terraform-init.sh
    ```
3.  **Deploy**:
    ```bash
    cd infrastructure/terraform
    terraform apply
    ```
    You will be prompted to enter your Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID.

### 2. Component Deployment

*   **`central-brain`**: This component is automatically built and deployed by the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/central-brain.yaml`) whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The Terraform deployment creates the necessary ECS service to run it.

*   **`edge-agent`**: The agent is designed to be run as a Docker container on the server you want to monitor. See the [Edge Agent README](edge-agent/README.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

## Usage

Once the infrastructure is up and the `edge-agent` is deployed, metrics will be collected every 5 minutes. The `central-brain` will analyze this data and send a Telegram message if the `up` metric for any monitored job is `0`.

## Future Work

*   Refine and expand the anomaly detection models.
*   Add more alerting channels (Email, Slack, PagerDuty).
*   Develop a web-based UI for visualizing metrics and anomalies.
